# Environment state: 0 = Clean, 1 = Dirty
rooms = {"A": 1, "B": 0}   # Room A is dirty, Room B is clean
vacuum_location = "A"

def vacuum_agent(location, state):
    if state == 1:
        print(f"Vacuum in {location}: Room dirty → CLEANING")
        rooms[location] = 0
    else:
        print(f"Vacuum in {location}: Room clean → MOVE")
        return "B" if location == "A" else "A"
    return location

# Run agent until both rooms are clean
while any(rooms.values()):
    vacuum_location = vacuum_agent(vacuum_location, rooms[vacuum_location])

print("All rooms are clean:", rooms)
